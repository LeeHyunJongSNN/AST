# Adatpive Synaptic Template (AST)
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) classifier files with Adaptive Synaptic Template

# Descritption
These files are main files for classifying data samples with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Diehl&Cook2015.
I built these files with BindsNET. 
Therefore, they demand BindsNET to operate.
To use AST, they require our add-on packages with additional features that I have developed.
Unfortunately, I do not have permission to upload the packages on Github.
Please install BindsNET and contact me to get the add-on packages.

# How to use AST with additional package
I cannot upload our add-on packages because I do not have permission to release.
If you need the package and more datasets, please e-mail me.
hetzer44@naver.com
Then, I will send the package and datasets.
For using the package, just put the package into the bindsnet folder in the python library folder (site-packages)

# Type
snn_wq.py is a Python file for classifying Wine Quality (WQ) dataset.
snn_digits.py is a Python file for classifying MNIST (8*8 pixels) dataset
